# Why Zero-Knowledge Proofs Make the ZK Afterlife Agent Awesome

## What’s the Deal with ZK in This Project?

So, picture this: you’ve got some crypto—ETH, USDC, maybe a fancy NFT—and you want to make sure it goes to your family if you’re not around anymore. That’s where the `zk-afterlife-agent` comes in. It’s like a digital will that kicks in if you stop checking in, maybe because you’ve passed away or lost access. The real magic? Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs), built on Aztec Network with a tool called Noir. They keep your will totally private, let it run without needing a lawyer, and still prove everything’s on the up-and-up. Let’s break it down in a way that makes sense, whether you’re a coder or just curious.

### Why We Need This

Imagine you’re setting up a will to split your crypto—say, 4 ETH to your daughter, 3 ETH to your son, and an NFT to your mom. You want a few things:

- Privacy: Nobody should know who gets what or how much until it’s time to execute.
- No Middleman: You don’t want to rely on a lawyer or bank to make it happen.
- Proof It’s Legit: The system has to follow your rules—like making sure your daughter’s over 18—without spilling the details.

On Ethereum, everything’s out in the open, so posting your will there is like putting it on a billboard. ZKPs fix this by letting us prove your will is valid without showing anyone what’s in it. Pretty neat, huh?

## What’s a Zero-Knowledge Proof?

A ZKP is like a crypto superpower. It lets you prove something’s true without giving away the details. It’s like convincing someone you know a secret without telling them what it is.

### A Quick Analogy

Say you’ve got a safe with a secret code. You can prove you know the code by opening it, without ever saying what the code is. I know the safe opened, but I’ve got no clue about the numbers.

In the `zk-afterlife-agent`, ZKPs prove your will follows all the rules—like the amounts add up and your beneficiaries are real—without putting any of that on the blockchain for everyone to see.

## How ZKPs Power the ZK Afterlife Agent

The `zk-afterlife-agent` uses ZKPs—specifically PLONK-based zk-SNARKs, built with Noir on Aztec Network—to keep things private and automated. It works in three steps: setting up your will, checking if you’re still active, and passing out assets if you’re not. Here’s how ZKPs make each step work like a charm.

### 1. Keeping Your Will Under Wraps (Setup Phase)

When you set up your will, you decide who gets what—like 4 ETH and 50 USDC to your daughter, 3 ETH to your son, and an NFT to your mom. You can add rules, like “my daughter needs to be over 18.” Here’s the process:

- You write this plan off-chain, like a private note on your computer, encrypted to stay safe.
- Using Noir, you create a ZK proof that checks:
    - Your will’s hash (think of it as a unique ID) matches what’s stored on Aztec.
    - The amounts add up to your total stash, like 10 ETH, 100 USDC, and 1 NFT.
    - Everyone’s addresses are legit Ethereum addresses.
    - Your rules, like age checks, are followed using some clever ZK math.
    - A Merkle tree hides the list of beneficiaries, so nobody knows who’s getting what until it’s time.
- This proof gets saved on Aztec’s private system, so the blockchain only sees a “yep, it’s good” signal, not your actual plan.

**What Stays Hidden**:

- How much you’re giving, like 10 ETH or 100 USDC.
- Who’s getting it.
- Any special rules, like age limits.**What Gets Proven**:
- Your will is valid and follows the rules.
- You set it up exactly as you wanted.

### 2. Checking If You’re Still Around (Inactivity Detection)

To make sure you’re still kicking, you send a quick “I’m here” transaction to an Ethereum contract every 12 months—you can tweak this timing if you want. If you miss a check-in (say, after about 525,600 blocks), a 30-day countdown starts, and we ping you and a trusted group—like your lawyer and brother—to make sure it’s not a false alarm. This group, called a veto multi-signature (multisig), can hit pause if you’re just off the grid for a bit.

ZKPs help by:

- Letting the Aztec contract check Ethereum’s “you’re inactive” signal without leaking your will’s details.
- Allowing the multisig to send a ZK-verified “stop” signal to reset the timer, keeping their identities private.

This way, nothing about your will gets out while we’re waiting to see if you’re still around.

### 3. Passing Out Assets Privately (Execution Phase)

If you’re confirmed inactive after the 30-day countdown, a trusted executor or your multisig team submits your will and a new ZK proof to the Aztec contract. The proof makes sure:

- Your will matches the secret hash stored earlier.
- The amounts add up and follow your rules, like age checks or Merkle tree checks.
- Everyone’s addresses are good to go.

Then:

- The contract splits your assets (stored as private UTXOs on Aztec) into chunks for each person, keeping it all quiet.
- Your family can keep their shares private on Aztec or move them to Ethereum, where they’d only show up if they cash out.
- If someone’s address is wrong, like a typo, their share goes to the executor to sort out, so nothing gets lost.
- If you pop back up, you can send a ZK-verified message to stop everything and reset the timer.

**Why This Is Great**: The blockchain never sees your will—it just trusts the ZK proof to make sure everything’s done right.

### A Real-Life Example

Let’s say Alice, a crypto fan, sets up the `zk-afterlife-agent`:

- **Her Plan**:
    - 4 ETH, 50 USDC, and 1 NFT to her daughter (who’s 21, so over 18).
    - 3 ETH and 50 USDC to her son.
    - 3 ETH to her mom.
- **What She Does**:
    - She writes this plan privately and encrypts it.
    - Using Noir, she makes a ZK proof that checks: her daughter’s age, the total (10 ETH, 100 USDC, 1 NFT), valid addresses, and a Merkle tree for beneficiaries.
    - She stores a hash of the plan on Aztec, like a digital fingerprint.
- **What Happens**:
    - Alice checks in every year on Ethereum. If she stops, a 30-day grace period starts, alerting her lawyer and brother.
    - If she’s really gone, her lawyer submits the proof and plan. The Aztec contract checks it and sends private shares to her family.
    - Her daughter moves her 4 ETH to Ethereum for spending, while her son and mom keep theirs private on Aztec.

Nobody knows the plan until it’s go-time, and it all happens without a hitch.

## Why ZKPs Are a Big Deal

This isn’t just nerdy crypto talk—ZKPs make the `zk-afterlife-agent` a game-changer for passing on your crypto. Here’s why:

| What ZK Does | Why It’s Awesome |
| --- | --- |
| Keeps Things Private | Nobody sees your will until it’s time. |
| Proves It’s Legit | Rules like sums or ages are checked securely. |
| No Trust Needed | No lawyers—just code and math do the work. |
| Works with Blockchain | Aztec’s system makes it secure and automatic. |

ZKPs let us handle tricky stuff—like checking your daughter’s age or keeping beneficiaries secret—without telling the world. It’s like having a super-smart, super-private assistant built into the blockchain.

## The Simple Takeaway

ZKPs let the `zk-afterlife-agent` prove your will is good to go without showing it to anyone—not even the blockchain. Here’s what that means:

- Your secrets stay safe: Who gets your crypto and how much? Nobody knows until it’s time.
- It runs itself: No need for a middleman—the blockchain handles it all.
- It’s solid: Your wishes are followed perfectly, no leaks.

This makes the `zk-afterlife-agent` a killer tool for crypto estate planning, letting you pass on your assets securely and privately.

## Why This Fits with Aztec’s Big Picture

By building on Aztec Network with Noir, we’re jumping into the future of private crypto apps. This project is all about keeping things confidential and lines up perfectly with Aztec’s Noir Grants Program (https://aztec.network/grants). We’re creating a reusable toolkit for private estate planning that could plug into other projects, like private lending on Aave or trading on Uniswap. It’s a win for us and the whole crypto world.
