# 🧪 Self Protocol Integration Testing Guide

## 📋 **Testing Checklist**

### **1. Contract Deployment Verification** ✅

- [x] Contract deployed on Celo Sepolia
- [x] Address: `0xAf61DbD79eAEaa2455065619063Fa5eb13fB0A4B`
- [x] Contract has code (21,582 characters)
- [x] Network: Celo Sepolia (Chain ID: 11142220)

### **2. Frontend Integration Testing**

- [ ] Test SelfVerification component loads
- [ ] Test method selection (passport/Aadhaar)
- [ ] Test QR code generation
- [ ] Test verification flow
- [ ] Test integration with will registration

### **3. Smart Contract Integration Testing**

- [ ] Test SelfHumanVerifier contract functions
- [ ] Test WillExecutor integration
- [ ] Test verification requirement enforcement
- [ ] Test error handling for unverified users

### **4. End-to-End Flow Testing**

- [ ] Complete verification flow
- [ ] Will registration with verification
- [ ] Bot prevention testing
- [ ] Age verification testing

## 🚀 **Next Steps to Complete Integration**

### **Step 1: Frontend Testing**

```bash
# Start the frontend development server
cd frontend
npm run dev

# Test the verification flow:
# 1. Navigate to will registration
# 2. Test Self verification step
# 3. Test method selection
# 4. Test QR code generation
# 5. Test complete flow
```

### **Step 2: Smart Contract Testing**

```bash
# Test contract functions
cd contracts
forge test --match-contract SelfHumanVerifier

# Test WillExecutor integration
forge test --match-contract WillExecutor
```

### **Step 3: Mock Verification Testing**

- Test with mock passport data
- Test with mock Aadhaar data
- Verify age calculation
- Test nationality detection

### **Step 4: Production Readiness**

- [ ] Update environment variables
- [ ] Configure proper verification config IDs
- [ ] Test with real Self Protocol integration
- [ ] Deploy to production network

## 🔧 **Configuration Updates Needed**

### **Environment Variables**

```env
# Add to frontend/.env.local
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_HUMAN_VERIFIER_ADDRESS=0xAf61DbD79eAEaa2455065619063Fa5eb13fB0A4B
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_HUB_ADDRESS=0x16ECBA51e18a4a7e61fdC417f0d47AFEeDfbed74
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_SCOPE=1
NEXT_PUBLIC_SELF_VERIFICATION_CONFIG_ID=0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001
```

### **Frontend Configuration**

- Update contract addresses in `config/contracts.ts`
- Configure proper verification config IDs
- Test with actual Self Protocol integration

## 📊 **Testing Results Expected**

### **Successful Integration Should Show:**

1. ✅ Self verification step appears first in will registration
2. ✅ Method selection works (passport/Aadhaar)
3. ✅ QR code generation works
4. ✅ Verification flow completes
5. ✅ Will registration requires verification
6. ✅ Bot prevention works (unverified users blocked)
7. ✅ Age verification works (18+ requirement)

### **Error Handling Should Work:**

1. ✅ Unverified users cannot register wills
2. ✅ Underage users are blocked
3. ✅ Invalid verification attempts are handled
4. ✅ Network errors are handled gracefully

## 🎯 **Partner Prize Verification**
